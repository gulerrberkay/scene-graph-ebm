# Energy-Based Learning in Weakly Supervised Scene Graph Generation

A repo that uses the formulation of [mod33](https://github.com/mods333/energy-based-scene-graph) to convert scene graph problem into a weak supervision problem. Some modifications on relation and energy losses applied with additional flags.


## Installation

The last version of each library shown in [mod33](https://github.com/mods333/energy-based-scene-graph) installation part. Some cuda files are edited to work with Torch 1.12.



## Acknowledgment

This repository is developed on top of the scene graph benchmarking framework developed by [mod33](https://github.com/mods333/energy-based-scene-graph) Mohammed Suhail and [KaihuaTang](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch).
